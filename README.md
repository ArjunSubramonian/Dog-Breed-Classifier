# Dog Breed Classifier
Python and Keras implementations of 3 different deep learning classifiers:

- Simple logistic regression unit
- Multi-layer fully-connected neural network
- 50-layer residual convolutional neural network (ResNet50)

that, given an image of a dog, can determine the dogâ€™s breed. The ResNet50 was initialized during training with pre-trained ImageNet weights and only trained partially due to a lack of computational power.
